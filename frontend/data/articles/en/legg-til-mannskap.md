# Add Crew

You can add more crew members to the projects after the registration is completed and approved. Also ensure to keep the crew list updated and ensure that all required information is entered for the crew.

Go to "Add crew" from the Home page in the HMSREG Portal.

1. **Select which project you want to add crew to from the drop-down menu**
2. **Check the box for the crew member you want to add to the project.**
    *   Can't find the card? The card must first be scanned via HMSREG's mobile app.
3. **Select 'add selected crew'**

Remember to fill in all information about the crew member, such as mobile number, category, trade group, language, and nationality. What needs to be filled out in the crew list varies from project to project, based on the client's requirements.

> **Tip:** After you have entered all information for the crew, go to 'My Company' and select 'update card information' so that the information is saved and can be reused on other projects.
