# Invite Subcontractor

If you need a contract helper/subcontractor, you can invite them after your company's registration has been processed and approved by the client.

Go to the Home page in the HMSREG Portal and select "Invite subcontractor" under My Tasks.

1. **Select which project you want to invite the subcontractor to from the drop-down menu**

2. **Fill in information**
    *   Search by organization number or name. The drop-down menu is blank until you start searching.
    *   Enter a short description of the field of work or what the subcontractor delivers to the project, e.g., electrical, demolition, groundwork, staffing.
    *   Choose the contract type for this delivery:
        *   *Hiring from a staffing agency*: The work is performed under the hirer's management and control, and it is the hirer who bears the risk for the work result.
        *   *Hiring from a production company*: Another production company mainly supplies labor. The work is performed under the hirer's management and control, and it is the hirer who bears the risk for the work result.
        *   *Contract/assignment agreement/other*: The contractor uses their own employees to perform work on behalf of a client. The contractor is obliged to deliver a specific result, and the employees are subject to the contractor's management and control, and not the hirer's.
    *   Enter mobile number. If the person already has a user in HMSREG, the name and email will be filled in automatically. If this is a completely new user, you must enter the name and email manually.

3. **Click 'send invitation'**
    The contact person for the subcontractor will receive an invitation to HMSREG so that they can complete the registration for their company.
