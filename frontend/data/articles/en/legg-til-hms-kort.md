# Add New HSE Cards

If you need to add completely new HSE cards for your company, the HSE card must be scanned via HMSREG's mobile app. The card will then become available in HMSREG and can be added to projects.

Note that you do not need the physical card to scan the QR code. It is sufficient to have a copy/printout/picture via email of the new card. Thus, one is not dependent on the employee scanning the code on the card themselves, and it is possible for the employer, administration, or others to scan their employees' cards based on a printout/copy.

Download the HMSREG mobile app from Apple Store/Google Play. You must have at least version 1.15.0 (iOS/iPhone) or version 5.15.1 (Android) to be able to scan the QR code.

1. **Open the HMSREG mobile app and click 'Scan HSE card' at the bottom.**
    You do not need to log in to the app to do this.

2. **Scan QR code.**

3. **Log in to https://portal.hmsreg.com/ and go to 'My Company'.**
    *   Fill in the mobile number in the 'mobile no. for verification' column. We perform a check against 1881.no to verify the mobile number. It may therefore take some time before the mobile number is verified.
    *   Fill in information such as category, trade group, main language, nationality, and 'industry experience from'.
    *   We recommend entering all information at once. It is then easy to register the crew on projects. All information entered here will be reused.

4. **Go to the relevant project via 'my deliveries' on the front page of the portal.**
    Pick up the HSE card and add it to the project. Ensure that all required information is entered (all columns in the crew list must be filled out).
