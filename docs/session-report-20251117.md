# Session Report: UX Design Workflow - Monday, 17 November 2025

This report summarizes the activities and outcomes of the UX Design session.

## 1. Agent Activation & Context Setup

*   The agent was activated as the **UX Designer** persona.
*   Project configuration (`.bmad/bmm/config.yaml`) was loaded, setting user context (BIP, English, output folder).
*   The UX Designer's menu was presented.

## 2. UX Design Specification Validation

*   **Initial Validation:** The `ux-design-specification.md` was initially validated against the `create-ux-design` workflow checklist. This revealed significant failures due to the perceived absence of visual collaboration artifacts (`ux-color-themes.html`, `ux-design-directions.html`).
*   **User Clarification:** The user provided `ux-showcase.html` as the existing mockup, clarifying that visual collaboration had indeed occurred.
*   **Corrected Validation:** A corrected validation was performed, incorporating `ux-showcase.html`. This significantly improved the validation score from **32% to 76%**, resolving most critical failures related to visual collaboration.
*   **Remaining Gaps Identified:**
    *   **Cross-Workflow Alignment:** The `epics.md` file had not been reviewed and updated based on the UX design.
    *   **Incomplete User Journeys:** Only the "Primary Information Retrieval" journey was documented; other critical journeys were missing.

## 3. Cross-Workflow Alignment: `epics.md` Update

*   The `epics.md` file was reviewed against the `ux-design-specification.md` and `ux-showcase.html`.
*   **Key Changes Applied to `epics.md`:**
    *   **Story 2.2 ("Develop Basic Chat UI in Frontend") was split** into three more granular stories to reflect the detailed responsive design:
        *   `Story 2.2.a: Implement Core Chat Interface`
        *   `Story 2.2.b: Implement Desktop Three-Column Responsive Layout`
        *   `Story 2.2.c: Implement Mobile Tabbed-Interface Layout`
    *   **Technical notes were added** to existing stories (2.5, 3.1, 4.2) to align their implementation details with the approved UX design and `ux-showcase.html`.
*   **Validation Report Update:** The validation report was updated to reflect the successful completion of the `epics.md` alignment, increasing the overall score to **83%** and reducing critical issues to one.

## 4. Design of Remaining User Journeys

*   Three additional user journeys were collaboratively designed and documented:
    *   **Negative Feedback Journey (Clarify & Retry):** When a user clicks "👎 Not Helpful," the chatbot prompts for clarification or rephrasing before offering human support.
    *   **Ambiguous Question Journey (Combined Funnel):** When a user asks a broad question, the chatbot offers both broad category buttons and specific suggested questions to guide clarification.
    *   **Export Current Conversation Journey:** A button is provided in the active chat interface to allow users to download the current conversation transcript locally, without server-side storage.
*   **`ux-design-specification.md` Update:** The `ux-design-specification.md` file was updated to include the detailed descriptions of these three new user journeys within the "User Journey Flows" section.

## 5. Session Conclusion

All identified user journeys have now been designed and documented, and the project's `epics.md` file has been aligned with the UX design. The project is in a strong position for the next phase of development.
