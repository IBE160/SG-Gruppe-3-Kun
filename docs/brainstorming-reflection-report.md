# Brainstorming Session Reflection Report

**Date:** Wednesday, 12 November 2025
**Topic:** User Problems and Pain Points - "Difficult to find the correct article"

This report provides a concise summary of our brainstorming session, including the prompts used to facilitate the discussion.

## Session Summary

The session focused on understanding why users find it difficult to locate the correct articles in the documentation. We used three techniques: Five Whys, Question Storming, and Mind Mapping.

### 1. Five Whys

This technique helped us drill down to the root cause of the problem.

**Prompts Used:**
*   "To start, let's consider a specific user problem or pain point you have in mind. What is a user problem you've observed or anticipate?"
*   "Why is it difficult to find the correct article?"
*   "Why does searching for keywords generate a lot of hits from different articles?"
*   "Why do many articles use the same terms?"
*   "Why is a lot of the functionality interconnected?"
*   "Why is the system itself very complex and has a ton of functionality?"

**Outcome:** We identified the root cause: the system's multi-purpose nature creates complexity that makes documentation hard to navigate.

### 2. Question Storming

This technique helped us explore the problem space by generating a wide range of questions.

**Prompts Used:**
*   "To start, what questions come to mind regarding why it's difficult for users to find the correct article, or what aspects of this problem we don't yet understand? Remember, only questions!"
*   "Keep those questions coming. What else don't we know about this problem? What other questions should we be asking to fully understand why it's difficult to find the correct article?"
*   "Let's keep the momentum going. What else should we be asking? Think about the user's journey, their expectations, and the content itself. What other questions come to mind?"
*   "Let's try to stay in the problem space a little longer. What questions can we ask about the *current* situation? For example, what questions do we have about the user's mindset or the search experience itself?"
*   "Let's build on that. What other questions do we have about the user's motivations or their experience with the documentation?"
*   "Now, what questions do we have about the articles themselves? What should we be asking about the content, format, or structure of the documentation?"

**Outcome:** We generated a list of key questions about user behavior, content quality, and search functionality.

### 3. Mind Mapping

This technique helped us visually organize the key aspects of the problem.

**Prompts Used:**
*   "Based on our 'Five Whys' and 'Question Storming' sessions, what are the main categories or branches that stem directly from this central problem?"
*   "Now, thinking about 'User behaviour,' what specific aspects or questions fall under this branch?"
*   "What other main branches do you see stemming from 'Difficult to find the correct article'?"
*   "Now, let's flesh out this branch. What specific issues or characteristics of the search functionality contribute to the difficulty in finding the correct article?"
*   "Now, under the 'Content quality' branch, what specific aspects or questions contribute to the difficulty in finding the correct article?"

**Outcome:** We created a mind map with three main branches: "User behaviour," "Search functionality," and "Content quality," each with specific sub-points.

## Key Outcomes and Action Items

Based on the session, we identified three top-priority action items:

1.  **AI Search:** Implement AI-powered search for more relevant results.
2.  **Article / Chapter Search:** Allow users to limit their search scope to specific chapters or articles.
3.  **Linked Articles:** Improve the interlinking of related articles to enhance discoverability.

These action items are part of a unified effort to improve content discoverability, with an estimated timeline of 4 weeks for initial exploration and implementation.
