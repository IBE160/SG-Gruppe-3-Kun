# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** Wednesday, 12 November 2025
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Difficult to find the correct article (User Problems and Pain Points)

**Session Goals:** To understand the root causes of difficulty in finding articles, generate questions, and categorize ideas for improvement.

**Techniques Used:** Five Whys, Question Storming, Mind Mapping

**Total Ideas Generated:** 15+ (including questions and specific issues)

### Key Themes Identified:

System complexity, user behavior, search functionality, content quality.

## Technique Sessions

### Five Whys Summary:
**Problem:** Difficult to find the correct article.
1.  **Why?** There are many articles, hard to know what to search for and searching for keywords generate a lot of hits from different articles.
2.  **Why?** Many articles use the same terms.
3.  **Why?** A lot of the functionality is interconnected.
4.  **Why?** Because the system itself is very complex and has a ton of functionality.
5.  **Why?** Because the system is used for a lot of different tasks.
**Root Cause:** The system's multi-purpose nature creates complexity that makes documentation hard to navigate.

### Question Storming Summary:
*   What do the users need help with most often?
*   Where do the users get stuck?
*   How can we guide the users to the correct article?
*   Why are users skipping the documentation and calling support?
*   What type of users use the docs most frequently?
*   Are the articles structured well enough?
*   Is it easy enough to find related articles?

### Mind Mapping Summary:
**Difficult to find the correct article**
*   **User behaviour**
    *   Not knowing the correct terms to search for
*   **Search functionality**
    *   No way to limit searches to specific chapters or articles
*   **Content quality**
    *   Are we using consistent terminology across the articles

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

*   Improving search by allowing users to limit search scope.
*   Using AI-powered search for more relevant results.

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research_

*   Ensuring consistent terminology across all articles.
*   Improving the structure and interlinking of articles.
*   General improvement of articles (though not a current priority).

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

*   Understanding why users skip the documentation.
*   Teaching users to use the correct search terms.

### Insights and Learnings

*   **Root Cause:** The system's multi-purpose nature creates complexity that makes documentation hard to navigate.
*   The session generated numerous questions about user behavior, content quality, and search functionality, highlighting key areas for investigation.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: AI search

- Rationale: Getting better hits, understanding what the user needs to find better.
- Next steps: Implementing the AI chatbot should also be able to search articles.
- Resources needed: Outlined in proposal.
- Timeline: Within 4 weeks.

#### #2 Priority: Article / chapter search

- Rationale: Being able to limit search to chapters would help finding only relevant articles depending on what part of the system you're working with.
- Next steps: Implementing the AI chatbot should also be able to search articles.
- Resources needed: Outlined in proposal.
- Timeline: Within 4 weeks.

#### #3 Priority: Linked articles

- Rationale: Being able to find relevant articles quickly, easier to learn more about specific functionality.
- Next steps: Implementing the AI chatbot should also be able to search articles.
- Resources needed: Outlined in proposal.
- Timeline: Within 4 weeks.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

Question Storming and Five Whys.

### Areas for Further Exploration

Possibly AI search.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

(Not explicitly recommended during the session, but could include further analysis of user behavior or content structure.)

### Questions That Emerged

Nothing at the moment.

### Next Session Planning
