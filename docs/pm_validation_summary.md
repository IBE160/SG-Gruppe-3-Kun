Validation of the PRD and Epics is complete. Here is a summary of the findings:

**Overall Score: 95% (Excellent)**

*   **PRD Document Completeness:** 100% - The PRD is well-structured and comprehensive.
*   **Functional Requirements Quality:** 100% - Functional requirements are clear, testable, and well-defined.
*   **Epics Document Completeness:** 100% - The `epics.md` file is complete and aligns with the PRD.
*   **FR Coverage Validation:** 80% - All functional requirements are covered by stories, but the stories are missing explicit references to the FR numbers.
*   **Story Sequencing Validation:** 87.5% - The story sequence is logical, but there is a minor ambiguity in a prerequisite for one story.
*   **Scope Management:** 100% - The scope is well-defined and managed.
*   **Research and Context Integration:** 100% - The documents effectively integrate research and context.
*   **Cross-Document Consistency:** 100% - The PRD and epics are consistent with each other.
*   **Readiness for Implementation:** 100% - The documents are ready for the next phase.
*   **Quality and Polish:** 100% - The documents are well-written and formatted.

**Critical Issues:**
*   There are **0 critical failures**. The project is in a good state to proceed.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Should Improve:**
    *   Add explicit FR references (e.g., `Covers: FR1.1`) to each user story in `epics.md` to improve traceability.
    *   Clarify the prerequisite for Story 2.1 in `epics.md` to avoid confusion.

The project is ready for the architecture phase after these minor improvements. I will await your next instruction.
