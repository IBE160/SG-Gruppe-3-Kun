I have implemented the suggested improvements in `epics.md`:

1.  **Explicit FR References:** I have added `Covers: FRx.x` to each relevant user story in `epics.md` to improve traceability.
2.  **Clarified Prerequisite for Story 2.1:** I have added a new story, Story 1.7 "Set up ChromaDB Vector Store", and updated Story 2.1's prerequisite to correctly reference it.

These changes enhance the clarity and traceability of the `epics.md` document.

I am now awaiting your next instruction.
