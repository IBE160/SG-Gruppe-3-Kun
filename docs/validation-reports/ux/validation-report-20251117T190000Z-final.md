**Checklist:** `D:\HIM\H25\IBE160\chatbot\SG-Gruppe-3-Kun\.bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/create-ux-design/checklist.md`
**Supporting Artifacts:**

## Summary (Final)
- **Overall:** 49/59 passed (83%)
- **Critical Issues:** 1

The project is in a very strong position. With the `epics.md` file now aligned with the UX design, the primary process gaps have been closed. The remaining critical issue is related to completing the design for all specified user journeys.

## Section Results

... (Sections 1-13 remain the same as the previous report) ...

### 14. Cross-Workflow Alignment (Epics File Update)
**Pass Rate:** 4/4 (100%)
- [✓] **Review epics.md file for alignment with UX design**
  - **Evidence:** This task was completed, and the `epics.md` file was updated in the previous turn.
- [✓] **New stories identified** during UX design
  - **Evidence:** Story 2.2 was split into three more detailed stories (2.2.a, 2.2.b, 2.2.c) to reflect the responsive layout complexity.
- [✓] **Existing stories complexity reassessed**
  - **Evidence:** Notes were added to stories 2.5, 3.1, and 4.2 to align them with the specifics of the visual design.
- [✓] **Action Items for Epics File Update**
  - **Evidence:** The `epics.md` file was successfully modified to reflect all alignment changes.

### 17. Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)
- [✓] **No visual collaboration**
- [✓] **User not involved in decisions**
- [✓] **No design direction chosen**
- [⚠] **No user journey designs** (Critical gap: Only one of several required journeys is designed.)
- ... (other items pass) ...

## Recommendations (Final)

1.  **Must Fix: Design Remaining User Journeys.** The highest priority is now to design the UX for the remaining critical user journeys derived from the PRD and `epics.md`. The current design only covers the primary information retrieval flow. We need to address other flows, such as handling user feedback and managing more complex, multi-turn conversations.
2.  **Consider: Update File Naming.** For future workflows, consider saving artifacts with the names the checklist expects (`ux-design-directions.html`, etc.) to avoid initial validation confusion.

The project is well-documented, visually defined, and aligned with the development plan. The next logical step is to complete the remaining design work.
