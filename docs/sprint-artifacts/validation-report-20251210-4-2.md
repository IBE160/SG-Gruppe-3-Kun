# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 4-2 - Develop User Feedback Mechanism
Outcome: FAIL (Critical: 0, Major: 2, Minor: 0)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

(None)

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

1. **Missing Source Document Citations**: The Dev Notes do not cite `epics.md`, `PRD.md`, `architecture.md`, `testing-strategy.md`, or `coding-standards.md`.
   *   Evidence: References section only lists `tech-spec-epic-4.md`.

2. **Missing Required Dev Notes Subsection**: The "Architecture patterns and constraints" subsection is missing from the Dev Notes.
   *   Evidence: Dev Notes section lacks this header.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

(None)

## Successes

1. **Clear Requirements**: Acceptance Criteria are precise and testable.
2. **Implementation Detail**: Tasks cover the full stack (Database, API, Frontend).
3. **UX Guidance**: Dev notes provide specific advice on UX ("subtle", "small icons").
