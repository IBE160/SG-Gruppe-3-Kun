  <title>Implement Role Selection UI</title>
  <story>
    As a frontend developer, I want to provide a clear and intuitive interface for users to select their role at the beginning of a session, so that the chatbot can understand their context and personalize responses.

  <productGoalAlignment>
    This story aims to enable personalized chatbot interactions by allowing users to define their role, thereby providing context for the chatbot to deliver more relevant and tailored responses, enhancing user satisfaction and efficiency.
