  <title>Connect Frontend Chat to Backend API</title>
  <story>
    As a full-stack developer, I want to establish communication between the frontend chat interface and the backend RAG API via SSE, so that users can send questions and receive real-time streaming answers.
  </story>
  <productGoalAlignment>
    This story is critical for enabling the core interactive functionality of the chatbot, allowing users to engage in real-time conversations and receive dynamic, streamed responses, which directly impacts user experience and the perceived responsiveness of the application.
