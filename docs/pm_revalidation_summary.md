The re-validation of the PRD and Epics is complete. I am pleased to report excellent results!

**Overall Score: 100% (Excellent)**

All previous partial items have been resolved:
*   **FR Coverage Validation:** Now 100%. Explicit FR references have been added to all relevant user stories in `epics.md`, significantly improving traceability.
*   **Story Sequencing Validation:** Now 100%. The prerequisite for Story 2.1 has been clarified by introducing Story 1.7, resolving the previous ambiguity.

**Critical Issues:**
*   There are **0 critical failures**. The project is in an excellent state to proceed.

The full, updated validation report has been saved to: `D:\HIM\H25\IBE160\chatbot\SG-Gruppe-3-Kun\docs\validation-report-20251115T123000Z.md`

The project is now fully ready for the architecture phase. I will await your next instruction.
